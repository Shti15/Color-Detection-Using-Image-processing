STEP 1 –Input: Capture video through webcam.
STEP 2 – Read the video stream in image frames.
STEP 3 – Convert the image frame in BRG (RGB color space represented as three 
matrices of red, green and blue with integer values from 0 to255 to HSV (huesaturation-value) color space . Hue describes a color in terms of saturation , 
represents the amount of gray color in that color and value describes the brightness 
or intensity of the color. This can can be represented as three matrices in the range 
of 0-179 , 0-255 and 0-255 respectively.
STEP 4 –Define the range of each color and create the corresponding mask.
STEP 5 – Morphological Transform : dilation, to remove noises from the 
images
STEP 6 – Create contour for the individual colors to display the detected color 
region distinguishly.
STEP 7 – Output : Detection of the colors in real-time.
